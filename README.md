# TDC1 Cosmology Forecasts

Cosmology forecasts based on the results of the first strong lens Time Delay Challenge. 

## Rough Plan

* Using the redshifts for each TDC1 lens system, generate mock Fermat potential differences for a reference cosmology, and add noise appropriate to the expected follow-up high resolution imaging data as well as some treatment of the external convergence.
* Combine with the measured TDC1 time delays to emulated inferred time delay distances for each submitted lens, for each submission (in the 10 that were listed in the TDC1 paper). 
* Emulate a joint analysis of each submission's ensemble, using CosmoSIS.
* Collect, compare and distill all the submissions' cosmological parameter constraints to make a community cosmology forecast.
* Design a suitable figure of merit to capture cosmology performance, and use them to quantify how the forecast varies with observing strategy, via comparison between rungs (as in the TDC1 paper). 
* Implement a MAF metric that enables any LSST observing strategy to be evaluated in terms of this figure of merit. 
* Place this in the wider context of Stage IV dark energy analysis.
